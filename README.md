 🏥 Clinic Appointment & Patient Management System

📌 Phase 1: Project Documentation  

 🔹 Project Title  
**Clinic Appointment & Patient Management System**

🔹 Problem Statement  
Local clinics and doctors often face challenges in managing patient appointments, medical history, and billing.  
Most small clinics still rely on manual registers or Excel sheets, which leads to:  
- Confusion in scheduling appointments  
- Scattered patient records  
- Difficulty in tracking revenue and payments  

A **centralized Salesforce CRM system** will be developed to help clinics manage patients and appointments efficiently.  

🔹 Objectives  
- Track patient inquiries and registrations  
- Manage and schedule appointments (Doctor, Date, Time)  
- Record billing and payments in Salesforce  
- Provide clear insights through **Reports & Dashboards** (patients per month, revenue generated)  

🔹 Scope of Work  
- **Leads** → New patient inquiries  
- **Contacts** → Registered patients  
- **Custom Object: Appointments** → Appointment details (Patient, Doctor, Date, Time, Status)  
- **Opportunities** → Billing / Payments  
- **Reports & Dashboards** →  
  - Monthly patient visits  
  - Revenue per doctor  
  - Appointment status (upcoming, completed, cancelled)  

🔹 Deliverables of Phase 1  
- Documented project idea (Problem + Objectives + Scope)  
- GitHub repository initialized with this README  
- Clear roadmap for Phase 2 (Salesforce configuration & implementation)  

🚀 Next Steps (Phase 2 Preview)  
- Create **Custom Objects & Fields** in Salesforce  
- Setup **Relationships** between Patients, Appointments, and Billing  
- Configure **Reports and Dashboards**  
- Test end-to-end flow of patient inquiry → appointment → billing
