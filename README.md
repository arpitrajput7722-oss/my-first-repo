# üìÑ Phase 3: Object & Data Model Setup (Clinic Project)

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Custom Objects

In this step, new custom objects were created to represent the core entities of the clinic system that are not available as standard Salesforce objects.

* **Patient** ‚Äì To capture details of each patient visiting the clinic.
* **Appointment** ‚Äì To manage scheduled visits between patients and doctors.
* **Invoice** ‚Äì To record billing and payment transactions for appointments.

These objects provide the foundation of the Clinic Management System and are visible in the Object Manager.


## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Essential Fields

Each custom object was enhanced with important fields to capture relevant information:

**Patient**

* *Date of Birth (Date):* To record patient age details.
* *Gender (Picklist):* Options ‚Äì Male, Female, Other.
* *Phone (Phone):* Primary contact number of the patient.
* *Medical History (Long Text):* Notes on previous conditions or allergies.

**Appointment**

* *Patient (Lookup ‚Üí Patient):* To link the appointment with the patient record.
* *Doctor (Lookup ‚Üí User):* To assign the doctor responsible for the appointment.
* *Appointment Date (Date/Time):* The scheduled date and time of the visit.
* *Status (Picklist):* Options ‚Äì Scheduled, Completed, Cancelled.
* *Reason (Text/Long Text):* Notes on the purpose of the visit.

**Invoice**

* *Appointment (Lookup ‚Üí Appointment):* To tie the invoice to a specific appointment.
* *Patient (Lookup ‚Üí Patient):* For direct patient reference.
* *Amount (Currency):* Total charge for the treatment or consultation.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create Relationships

Relationships were set up to connect the custom objects with each other and with standard objects:

* **Appointment ‚Üí Patient (Lookup Relationship):** Links every appointment to a registered patient.
* **Appointment ‚Üí Doctor (Lookup ‚Üí User):** Associates the appointment with the doctor handling it.
* **Invoice ‚Üí Appointment (Lookup Relationship):** Ensures that billing records are tied to appointments.
* **Invoice ‚Üí Patient (Lookup Relationship):** Provides direct visibility into the patient‚Äôs billing history.

These relationships ensure that all data is connected, making it easier to generate reports and dashboards.


## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Page Layouts

Page layouts were customized to improve usability and ensure that the most important fields are visible during record creation or editing:

* **Patient Layout:** Shows patient demographics (DOB, Gender, Phone) and displays related appointments.
* **Appointment Layout:** Displays patient lookup, doctor assignment, appointment date/time, and status.
* **Invoice Layout:** Includes fields for patient, appointment, amount, payment status, and payment date.

This customization ensures that end users such as receptionists and doctors can quickly enter and retrieve information.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Create Sample Records

Sample records were created to test the system and verify that relationships are working correctly:

* **Patient:** Rakesh Kumar(Male, 35 years, Phone: +91-9876543210).
* **Doctor (User):** Dr. Rajpoot (created as a Salesforce user).
* **Appointment:** Rakesh Kumar booked with Dr. Rajpoot on *25 Sept*, Status: Scheduled.
* **Invoice:** Linked to the appointment, with an amount of ‚Çπ1000, Status: Pending.

These records confirm that data is flowing correctly between Patient, Appointment, and Invoice objects.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Schema Builder

The **Salesforce Schema Builder** was used to visually map and confirm the data model. It clearly shows how the custom objects are connected to each other through lookup relationships.

* Patient connected to Appointment.
* Appointment connected to Doctor (User).
* Invoice connected to Appointment and Patient.

This visual representation validates the design and can be used for documentation and presentations.

‚úÖ With these steps, the **data model for AR Clinic** is fully established. Patients, doctors, appointments, and billing are now logically connected, making it easier to extend the project with automation, reports, and dashboards in the next phase.
