Phase 8: Data Management & Deployment (Clinic Management System)


A. Data Preparation & Compliance
 * Final Data Validation: Clean and validate all legacy patient, appointment, and billing data for import readiness.
 * Compliance Audit: Verify system adherence to healthcare regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) concerning data privacy and security.
 * Security Configuration: Implement and audit role-based access controls (RBAC), data encryption, and secure authentication methods.

B. Deployment to Production
 * Production Environment Setup: Provision and configure the final live servers, database, and network infrastructure.
 * Data Migration Execution: Execute the planned scripts to securely import all validated historical data into the new CMS database.
 * Code Deployment: Deploy the finalized, tested application code (web/backend/API) to the production environment.
 * System Smoke Test: Perform a crucial end-to-end check of core workflows (e.g., patient registration, scheduling, billing) on the live system.

C. Launch & Post-Deployment
 * Staff Training Completion: Conduct final, role-specific training sessions for all clinic staff on the live system.
 * Go-Live Announcement: Officially launch the new CMS system for all daily operations.
 * Hypercare Support: Provide intensive, immediate support (24/7 or on-site) for the first few weeks post-launch to address critical issues.
 * Performance Monitoring: Establish continuous monitoring for system uptime, response time, and database health.
 * Backup & Disaster Recovery: Implement and regularly test automated data backup and disaster recovery procedures.
