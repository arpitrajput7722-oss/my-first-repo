üè• Clinic Appointment & Patient Management System

üìå Phase 1: Project Documentation

üîπ Project Title
Clinic Appointment & Patient Management System

üîπ Problem Statement
Local clinics and doctors often face challenges in managing patient appointments, medical history, and billing.
Most small clinics still rely on manual registers or Excel sheets, which leads to:

Confusion in scheduling appointments
Scattered patient records
Difficulty in tracking revenue and payments
A centralized Salesforce CRM system will be developed to help clinics manage patients and appointments efficiently.

üîπ Objectives

Track patient inquiries and registrations
Manage and schedule appointments (Doctor, Date, Time)
Record billing and payments in Salesforce
Provide clear insights through Reports & Dashboards (patients per month, revenue generated)
üîπ Scope of Work
