🔹 Project Title

Local clinics and doctors often face challenges in managing patient appointments, medical history, and billing.
Most small clinics still rely on manual registers or Excel sheets, which leads to:

Provide clear insights through Reports & Dashboards (patients per month, revenue generated)
🔹 Scope of Work

Custom Object: Appointments → Appointment details (Patient, Doctor, Date, Time, Status)
Opportunities → Billing / Payments
Reports & Dashboards →
